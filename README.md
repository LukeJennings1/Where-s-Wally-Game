Wheres Wally Fullstack Game

LIVE DEMO URL LINK: https://lukejennings1.github.io/Wheres-Wally-Game/ 

Built using React, CSS3, HTML5 && Firebase (backend)

The game works by layering a css grid over the wheres wally image. It then has function calls on the locations of each character that needs to be found. Once a selection is made the game verifies with the backend database that the location of the chosen character is correct.

Finally, the user is given an option to submit the time taken to complete the game. This leaderboard is retreived / saved to the backend firebase database.
