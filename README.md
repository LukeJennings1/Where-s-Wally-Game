Wheres Wally Game

Game Plan: 

1. Build UI 
    1.1. - Create General UI (Header/Footer/Middle) - Made
    1.2. - Create Middle Container for the where's wally image to go - Made
            if I click the middle container is needs to create that dropdown - Made


    1.3. - When we click it needs to create a dropdown box with options that goes away when the user clicks away - Made
    
2.
    2.1. - Create backend that allows us to check whether the player has clicked on the correct location of that character
           on the photo (look this up). I think this is done by creating a dataBase where the grid location of each character is located. Then, when we select a grid + a character it will check the database correct grid location for that character against the input. If the input is currect we can display that and if the input is incorrect it wont display it.
